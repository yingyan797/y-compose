DFA for formula with free variables: A B 
Initial state: 0
Accepting states: 3 
Rejecting states: 0 1 2 

Automaton has 4 states and 5 BDD-nodes
Transitions:
State 0: XX -> state 1
State 1: 0X -> state 1
State 1: 1X -> state 2
State 2: X0 -> state 2
State 2: X1 -> state 3
State 3: XX -> state 3
A counter-example of least length (0) is:
A               X 
B               X 

A = {}
B = {}

A satisfying example of least length (2) is:
A               X 1X
B               X X1

A = {0}
B = {1}
